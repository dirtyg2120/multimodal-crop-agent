The "Observe → Verify → Reason → Act" Loop.

High-level architectural diagram.

\section{Module A: Adaptive Perception (The Vision Pipeline)}

%4.2.1 Image Pre-processing: Laplacian Variance for blur detection and brightness gating.
%
%4.2.2 Adaptive Inference: Logic for triggering SAHI (Slicing) vs. Standard Inference based on resolution.
%
%4.2.3 Prompt Engineering Strategy: Designing robust ontology prompts (e.g., "tomato leaf . caterpillar . beetle").
%
%4.2.4 The Verification Layer: Using CLIP to filter False Positives (The "Semantic Filter").

\section{Module B: Knowledge Retrieval (The RAG Pipeline)}
%4.3.1 Knowledge Base Construction: Sourcing IPM Manuals and PDFs.
%
%4.3.2 Chunking and Indexing Strategy in ChromaDB.
%
%4.3.3 Query Expansion: Transforming visual tags into semantic search queries.

\section{Module C: Orchestration (The Agent)}

%4.4.1 Pydantic AI Implementation: Defining the State Schema and Type-Safe JSON outputs.
%
%4.4.2 Decision Logic: Routing rules (e.g., differentiating "Benign Bug" from "Pest").
