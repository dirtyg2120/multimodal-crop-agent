\section{Experimental Setup}
%Hardware specs (GPU/TPU usage).
%Evaluation Metrics (mAP, IoU for Vision; Precision/Recall for Retrieval).
\section{Perception Benchmarking (Vision)}
%7.2.1 Grounding DINO vs. YOLOv8 (Zero-shot vs. Supervised trade-off).
%
%7.2.2 Efficacy of SAHI on small objects.
\section{Cognition Benchmarking (Logic)}
%7.3.1 RAG Retrieval Accuracy (Did it find the right manual?).
%
%7.3.2 Agent Decision Quality (Did it recommend the right chemical?).


\section{Discussion}

%Analysis of Latency vs. Accuracy trade-offs.
