	\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
	Online social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, have become an important part of people's daily lives in recent years since they allow them to connect with others, communicate with friends, share personal content with others, and obtain information, especially during the ongoing worldwide disaster---the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it also creates opportunities for social bots that are designed to replicate the behaviors of normal human accounts. Most of these bots are used for nefarious purposes such as disseminating false information, artificially amplifying the popularity of a person or movement or spreading spam. This proposal presents a review of some techniques that have emerged and designed to differentiate between social bot accounts and human accounts. We restrict the analysis to the detection of social bots on the Twitter social media platform for the time being, with plans to expand to Facebook later. We also compare the experiments of each technique on two different data sets to point out the most accurate one. Besides experimenting, our final destination is to develop a social bot detection tool that can be deployed as a web application. Finally, we highlight the challenges that remain in the domain of social bots detection and consider future directions for research efforts that are designed to address this problem.
